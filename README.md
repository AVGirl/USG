## The USG is Good, not Bad
The USG is a firewall for your USB ports, protecting your computer from [BadUSB](https://srlabs.de/badusb/). It connects between your computer and your untrusted USB device, isolating the badness and keeping your computer safe.

## v1.0 Firmware
This is the firmware branch for the pre-assembled USG v1.0. If you want to build your own USG out of development boards, clone the [v0.9 branch](https://github.com/robertfisk/USG/tree/USG_0.9) instead.
