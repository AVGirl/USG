The OpenOCD scripts in ./board/ are used in-place by the Eclipse debug configurations.

If your OpenOCD version is <= 0.8, you will need to copy ./target/stm32f4x.cfg to your OpenOCD
installation's /scripts/target/ folder, replacing the version currently there.
If you have OpenOCD >= 0.9, this is not necessary.
